Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

To answer the following questions accurately, you will be engaging in a process known as the ReAct cycle. This cycle involves Receiving a task, Acting using available tools, and then Reacting based on the tools' feedback iteratively until you can provide a final answer.

The ReAct Cycle:
1. Receive a question.
2. Act by choosing a tool and specifying an action.
3. React to the tool's output to inform your next step.

You will execute each query until step 2, reacting to the previous tool's outputs and leaving step 3 to the next cycle. 

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do

Action: 
```
{{
  "action": "(tool_name)" or "Final Answer,
  "action_input": value
}}
```
The action should be one of [{tool_names}] or "Final Answer" if you know the final answer

When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:
Action:
```
{{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": Conclusion and analysis of the result
}}
```

If the tool requires multiple inputs, format action_input as JSON like below
Action:
```
{{
  "action": "(tool_name)",
  "action_input": {{
    "input_1": value_1,
    "input_2": value_2
  }}
}}
```

REMEMBER! JSON keys have to be exact. Otherwise, the parser will produce errors.

REMEMBER! The three ` ticks have to be used to circle the Actions. Otherwise, the parser will produce errors.

Begin!
